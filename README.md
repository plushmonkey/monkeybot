- Windowed mode.  
- Constant window focus.  
- Default brightness settings.  
- Default keybindings.  
- Disable rolling ships

## Running
- Change the Level variable in the config file. Check %localappdata%/virtualstore if you can't find it.  
- Sometimes the keys will stick after closing the bot. Just press left, right, up, down, and control to fix it.  
- You can run the bot in a virtual machine if you want to be able to still use the computer normally.
